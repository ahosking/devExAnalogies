# DevEx Analogies

## Analogies Defined

| Analogy | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Cycling: Cadence + Power = Speed](analogies/cycle-time.md) | Explains why cycle time alone is insufficient - true productivity requires balancing speed (cadence) with impact (power) |
| [Input vs Output Metrics](analogies/input-output-metrics.md) | Clarifies activity (inputs) vs outcomes (outputs); uses health and family analogies to frame metrics responsibly and avoid gaming |

## To Define

1. Health Analogies
2. Cycling Analogies
3. Blood test/healthy ranges
4. Comparing your love for Family to DevEx Metrics
