            👋 Thanks for opening your first issue! 
            
            This repository collects DevEx analogies to help explain developer experience concepts in relatable ways.
            
            If you're sharing a new analogy, we'd love to hear:
            - What DevEx concept it explains
            - Why the analogy resonates with you
            - Any edge cases where it breaks down
            
            Looking forward to your contribution!

            🎉 Thanks for your first pull request!
            
            A few things to help get your analogy merged:
            - Make sure your analogy clearly maps to a DevEx concept
            - Include context on when/why you'd use this explanation
            - Check that markdown formatting is clean
            
            The maintainer will review soon. Thanks for contributing to better DevEx explanations!
